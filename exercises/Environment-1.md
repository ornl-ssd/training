title: Environment 1 - Development environment
---

1. Ensure that your development environment has been set up correctly, and that you can compile and run a simple C++ program.

2. Using Eclipse CDT (or PyDev), create a simple Hello World C++ project, and ensure that you can build and run it.

3. Add a new source file to the project containing a simple C++ function (e.g. func.cpp). Modify the main source file to call
   the new function. Ensure that you can build and run the program.
   
4. Add a header file to the project containing a definition of the function defined in #3 (e.g. func.h), and include the header 
   file (using the `#include` statement) in the main source file. Ensure you can build and run the program.
   
5. Launch the Eclipse debugger and complete the [following challenge](https://ornl-training.github.io/cpp-dev-env/01-cdt/#breakpoints).
